# Steam Profile Detailed Status

Shows a user's actual online state (Busy, Away, etc.) on their Steam profile, even when in-game. Also shows the date when they registered their account, even if they don't have a Years of Service badge. Only works on public profiles, however.

You need to register an [API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) before it will work. It will display a notification when you try to view a profile if you don't have one. If you don't have a domain that's okay, just use "localhost".

Requires Greasemonkey on Firefox and Tampermonkey on Chrome.
